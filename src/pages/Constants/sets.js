Mary went to school but forgot to bring her lunch box with her lunch food. She asked her teacher if she could borrow some food, but her teacher said that she didn't have anything. Mary was so embarrassed and didn't know what to do. 

Luckily, her friend Alex had brought some extra food. He gave Mary an apple, a sandwich, and some chips. Mary was so thankful and happy. She thanked Alex for being so kind and sharing his food. 

At the end of the school day, Mary was able to give back the food to Alex. He smiled and said that she could keep the sandwich and chips to bring home. Mary was so grateful and smiled back at Alex.
